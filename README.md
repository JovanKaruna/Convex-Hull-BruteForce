# Convex Hull Solver
This is a solver for convex hull using Brute Force with GUI 

### Running
1. compile files on ./src or open cmd/terminal on ./bin directory
1. `javac Main.java`
1. `java Main`

### Input
n = points to be randomly generated

### Output
- Randomly generated points with n-many.
- List of points that make a convex hull
- Time needed to run the algorithm
- GUI
